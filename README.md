Won 1st place for XDHacks 2019 hackathon !ðŸ¥‡ðŸš€

First of all, we would like to thank the organizers, sponsors, and mentors of XdHacks for providing such a great experience! Sustainable health was an interesting topic to think about and we settled on targeting the sustainability of BCâ€™s healthcare system by building a React Native app that helps patients better manage their rheumatoid arthritis. We chose rheumatoid arthritis because biologic drugs have risen to become BCâ€™s costliest publicly-funded drugs (80 to 182 million from 2011-2017), while also demonstrating a poor adherence rate (11-65%). Going forward, we will dive more into the research at the UBC Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences and see what we can learn about building and improving on patient engagement apps like Kenko. A special shout-out to Dr. Mary De Vera and her colleagues for their work in rheumatoid arthritis and medication adherence! Our team would like to thank all of our peers who came to this eventâ€”there were many interesting projects and we enjoyed listening to all of the pitches!
